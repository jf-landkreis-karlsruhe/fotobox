# fotobox_frontend

The web Frontend of the fotobox application

## Getting Started

### Build the web app

Use the following command:

    flutter build web

This results in the app being built to the /build/web directory.

See also [Build and release a web app](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web).

### Start/Test locally

To start the frontend locally, you need a basic web server. A simple variant is to use python as follows:

    python -m http.server 8000

You can do this either directly from the built web directory of the application, or by appending the directory to above command (via '-d [PathToDirectory]')
